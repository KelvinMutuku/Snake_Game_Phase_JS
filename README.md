Snake Game
A classic Snake game built from scratch using the Phaser 3 framework, following a tutorial from freeCodeCamp. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts like game loops, collision detection, and sprite management in a fun and interactive way.

Project Description
This repository contains the source code for a simple yet engaging Snake game. The game is developed using the Phaser 3 library, a fast, free, and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games. The project is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in learning about 2D game development.

Key features of the game include:

Smooth snake movement and growth

Food generation and consumption

Collision detection with the snake's body and game boundaries

Real-time score tracking

Technologies Used
Phaser 3: The primary game development framework.

JavaScript (ES6+): The programming language used to write the game logic.

HTML5: For the game's canvas and basic structure.

CSS3: For styling the main page.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
You need a web browser that supports HTML5. No special server environment is required to run this game, as it can be opened directly from the file system.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/KelvinMutuku/Snake_Game_Phase_JS.git](https://github.com/KelvinMutuku/Snake_Game_Phase_JS.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository-name

Open the game:
Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

How to Play
Movement: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.

Objective: Eat the food (red dot) to grow the snake and increase your score.
